# Why do I have no ideas or creative energy??

I frequently ask myself this question, and I think the main answer has to be the fear of failure or of not following through on my plans.
When there's pressure on me to do something exciting, big, creative and orginial I always rush too much, putting a lot of pressure on myself to get it right or be great at it that I just end up not doing anything at all.
