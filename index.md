# Hope you're having a good day

## Some things about me
* I'm currently doing a Bsc at the University of Auckland, majoring in Statistics.
* I'm **terrible** with planning in advance and am unpredictable so I might change majors in the future, or I migh not. Who knows?
* I like telling people about my interests, so I **will** force my incoherent babblings on the nearest person.

## The meme you've been waiting for:
![](mymeme.png)

### An explanation for the meme.
1. I like exercising :muscle:.
2.  I like telling people about my interests.
3.  This meme format is fairly typical and is also a good way to let as many people as possible know that I like working out.
4.  I find it hard to get started in winter and summer though, since:
  * lying in bed is so much easier than going into the cold to work out
  * I get sweaty working out in summer :rage:
 
 Thank you for visiting :)
