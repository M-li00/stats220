## Some things about me
* I'm currently doing a BSc at the University of Auckland, majoring in Statistics.
* I'm **terrible** with planning in advance and am unpredictable so I might change majors in the future, or I might not.
* I like telling people about my interests, so I **will** force my incoherent babblings on the nearest person.
* I have many interests such as ![anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime), reading ðŸ“–, and listening to music ðŸŽ¼.

## The meme you've been waiting for:
![](mymeme.png)

### An explanation for the meme.
1. I like exercising :muscle:.
2.  I like telling people about my interests.
3.  This meme format is _fairly typical_ and is also a good way to let as many people as possible know that I like working out.
4.  I find it hard to get started in winter and summer though, since:
> * lying in bed is so much easier than going into the cold to work out
> * I get sweaty working out in summer :rage:
 
 Thank you for visiting :)
