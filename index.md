## Some things about me
* I'm currently doing a BSc at the University of Auckland, majoring in Statistics.
* I'm **terrible** with planning in advance and am unpredictable so I might change majors in the future, or I might not.
* I like telling people about my interests, so I **will** force my incoherent babblings on the nearest person.
* I have many interests such as ![anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime), reading ðŸ“–, and listening to music ðŸŽ¼.

## The meme you've been waiting for:

```

##code for panel row 1 text
panel1 <- image_blank(width = 500,
                      height = 340,
                      color = "#000000") %>%
  image_annotate(text = "working out in\nspring/autumn",
                 color = "#FFFFFF",
                 size = 40,

not_happy <- image_read("https://happymag.tv/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/F-14.jpg") %>%
  image_scale(510)

#row1 image with text

row1<- c(happy_runner, panel1) %>%
  image_append()


#row2 image with text

row2 <- c(not_happy, panel2) %>%

```

### An explanation for the meme.
1. I like exercising :muscle:.
2.  I like telling people about my interests.
3.  This meme format is _fairly typical_ and is also a good way to let as many people as possible know that I like working out.
4.  I find it hard to get started in winter and summer though, since:
> * lying in bed is so much easier than going into the cold to work out
> * I get sweaty working out in summer :rage:
 
 Thank you for visiting :)
